        GBL Productions is a Bangalore-based independent music label dedicated to creating <strong>authentic, original,
          and AI-free music.</strong>
        Founded by <strong>Kartik Mishra</strong>,
        GBL Productions is the creative culmination of a deep passion for music, storytelling, and collaboration. As a
        proudly homegrown label, we specialize in <strong>end-to-end song creation</strong>—right from conceptualizing

        At the heart of GBL Productions is a commitment to genuine human creativity. In an era where artificial
        intelligence is increasingly used in music generation, we take a principled stand to keep our artform human-led,
        emotional, and organic. Every track we produce reflects the raw, unfiltered talent of the artists behind it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mission extends beyond just producing music—we strive to be a nurturing ground for young and talented music
        producers. By offering them real-world opportunities to work on our compositions, we help cultivate fresh voices
        in the Indian music landscape. Alongside our in-house work, we actively collaborate with respected production
        entities like Dream Art Records (Assam) and Bassleela Music (Delhi) to push the boundaries of creative exchange
        and regional diversity.

        With a focus on quality, originality, and artistic integrity, GBL Productions is emerging as a bold and
        independent voice in India’s evolving music industry.
